History in the making. Exaggeration? You be the judge. This last week Daniel Dabek announced the release of the whitepaper on the new Safe Exchange. More than just a protocol, it is the core tool kit necessary to establish a decentralized contract marketplace, via which anyone will be capable of exchanging with anyone, anywhere, according to prearranged contractual conditions.

We discuss the current crowdsale, designed to raise the modest capital needed to finish development, but also to distribute governance of the exchange a much as possible amongst the future users of it.

This is one you really don't want to miss. It will change your vision of how things can be when "Free Trade" is more than just a political buzzword.
