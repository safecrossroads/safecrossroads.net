#### In this Episode

In Class VI of SAFE Network School, we round out a deeper view of the remaining component factors necessary to establishing and maintaining the SAFE Network as an autonomous entity.

We've come far pilgrims, and through the heaviest going--hopefully--but there is more to come. So take time to really let everything we've covered so far sink in. Put in some time going over it all a time or two more, if you can. It will help as you go forward.
