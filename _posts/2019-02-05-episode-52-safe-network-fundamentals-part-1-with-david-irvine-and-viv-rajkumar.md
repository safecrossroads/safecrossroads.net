This is part 2 of a wide ranging discussion about the SAFE Network, with the two people most familiar with all aspects of it, MaidSAFE's Founder and CEO, David Irvine and CTO, Viv Rajkumar.

To guide our discussion we focused on the 21 Fundamentals of the SAFE Network as linked below. Amongst many other great insights, in this section David goes briefly over each fundamental and summarizes where each stands -- i.e., what's done and what is yet to be done.
